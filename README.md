# Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode Journey

Hi!  ðŸ‘‹ 

This repo is tracking the progress of my **#100DaysOfCode** progress while learning Python.

Things to expect:

 - ~~Good~~ **Terrible** coding structure and practices.
 - Possibly snarky comments about myself in files.
 - Legitimate Caveman era mathematics ability
  
Things **not** to expect:

 - Code that's readable, follows best practices or even makes sense.
 - Code that actually works - I think everyone knows the sheer amazement and panic of code working successfully on the first attempt.
 - The meaning of life.  

I'm working through Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python course alongside studying at university.
